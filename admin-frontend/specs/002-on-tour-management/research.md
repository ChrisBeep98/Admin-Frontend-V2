# Research for Tour Management Modal

This document outlines the research and decisions made to resolve ambiguities in the implementation plan.

## 1. API Endpoints and Data Structures

**Decision**: We will assume standard RESTful endpoints for `Tour` and `Itinerary` entities.

*   **Tour API**:
    *   `GET /api/tours/{tourId}`: Fetches tour details.
    *   `PUT /api/tours/{tourId}`: Updates tour details.
*   **Itinerary API**:
    *   `GET /api/tours/{tourId}/itinerary`: Fetches the itinerary for a tour.
    *   `PUT /api/tours/{tourId}/itinerary`: Updates the entire itinerary for a tour.

**Data Structures**:
*   **Tour**: Based on `src/models/Tour.ts`.
*   **Itinerary**: Based on `src/models/Itinerary.ts`.

**Rationale**: This is a standard and predictable RESTful pattern.

**Alternatives considered**: A single endpoint to update both tour and itinerary was considered but rejected to maintain separation of concerns.

## 2. API DTOs vs. Frontend Models

**Decision**: The API will use DTOs that are closely aligned with the frontend models. We will assume no major differences for now.

**Rationale**: This simplifies development and avoids unnecessary mapping logic.

**Alternatives considered**: Having significantly different DTOs and frontend models was considered but deemed overly complex for the current requirements.

## 3. Logging Library

**Decision**: We will use `console.log` for basic logging during development. A more robust logging library can be introduced later if needed.

**Rationale**: Simplicity. The project does not seem to have a logging library yet.

**Alternatives considered**: `winston`, `pino`.

## 4. Frontend Log Aggregation

**Decision**: Frontend logs will not be sent to a backend service at this time.

**Rationale**: No existing infrastructure for this.

**Alternatives considered**: Sending logs to a service like Datadog or Sentry.

## 5. Application Version

**Decision**: We will assume the version is `1.0.0`.

**Rationale**: No versioning information is available.

**Alternatives considered**: None.
