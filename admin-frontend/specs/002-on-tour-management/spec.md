# Feature Specification: Tour Management Modal

**Feature Branch**: `002-on-tour-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "on tour management list, every item is clickable and opens a modal, this modal has 2 tabs, one for the tour details, with its update feature; and other tab with the itinerary setup/ update info feature. every item should be updatable"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an admin, I want to be able to click on a tour in the tour management list to open a modal where I can easily view and update both the main tour details and the tour's itinerary in separate tabs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the tour management page with a list of tours, **When** I click on a tour item, **Then** a modal window opens.
2. **Given** the tour modal is open, **When** I view the "Tour Details" tab, **Then** I see the current details for the selected tour.
3. **Given** I am on the "Tour Details" tab, **When** I modify a field and save, **Then** the tour information is updated and the changes are reflected.
4. **Given** the tour modal is open, **When** I click on the "Itinerary" tab, **Then** I see the itinerary information for the selected tour.
5. **Given** I am on the "Itinerary" tab, **When** I add, edit, or delete an itinerary item and save, **Then** the tour's itinerary is updated.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a tour has no itinerary? The itinerary tab should show a clear message and an option to create one.
- How does the system handle an attempt to save invalid data in the tour details (e.g., empty required fields)?
- What happens if there is a network error while saving the tour or itinerary? The system should notify the user and not lose the changes.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST display a list of tours on the tour management page.
- **FR-002**: Each tour item in the list MUST be clickable.
- **FR-003**: Clicking a tour item MUST open a modal dialog.
- **FR-004**: The modal MUST contain two tabs: "Tour Details" and "Itinerary".
- **FR-005**: The "Tour Details" tab MUST display the details of the selected tour.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow users to update the information in the "Tour Details" tab.
- **FR-007**: The "Itinerary" tab MUST display the itinerary for the selected tour.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST allow users to set up and update the itinerary from the "Itinerary" tab.
- **FR-009**: All updates MUST be persistent.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide feedback to the user upon successful or failed updates.
- **FR-011**: The modal MUST have a way to be closed (e.g., a close button or clicking outside the modal).
- **FR-012**: The system MUST handle tours with no existing itinerary gracefully. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the default state? A blank editor, a prompt to create one?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tour**: Represents a tour package. Attributes include name, description, price, duration, etc. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific fields for a Tour?]
- **Itinerary**: Represents the schedule for a tour. It is composed of a sequence of events or stops. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific fields for an Itinerary item? e.g., day, location, activity, description]
