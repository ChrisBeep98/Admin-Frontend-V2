# Implementation Plan: Tour Management Modal

**Branch**: `002-on-tour-management` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-on-tour-management/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature will introduce a modal dialog for managing tours. Users will be able to click on a tour from a list to open a modal with two tabs: one for general tour details and another for the tour's itinerary. Both sections will support viewing and updating data. The core technical approach involves using a React-based modal component, managing state for the two tabs, and interacting with a RESTful API to fetch and update tour and itinerary data.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript, React 19.1.1
**Primary Dependencies**: Material-UI (`@mui/material`), `react-router-dom`
**Storage**: RESTful API - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific API endpoints and data structures for Tour and Itinerary updates]
**Testing**: `npm test && npm run lint`
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend/backend)
**Performance Goals**: Modal should open in < 500ms. Data updates should feel instantaneous to the user, with background processing.
**Constraints**: "execute the implementation planing for the new spec well"
**Scale/Scope**: The modal will handle all fields for a single tour and its associated itinerary, which could have up to 50-100 items.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend, backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Will the API use DTOs that differ from the frontend models?]
- Avoiding patterns? Yes, starting with a simple component-based architecture.

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a feature within a larger frontend application.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes, will use a mock server for API endpoints.
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What logging library is in use?]
- Frontend logs → backend? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a logging service to send frontend logs to?]
- Error context sufficient? Will be ensured during implementation.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the current version of the application?]
- BUILD increments on every change? N/A
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType gemini` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create a new TourModal component.
- Fetch tour data and itinerary data from the API.
- Implement the two tabs for Tour Details and Itinerary.
- Create forms for updating tour and itinerary data.
- Implement the logic to save the updated data to the API.
- Write unit and integration tests for the new components and services.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
