# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Admin Application

**Branch**: `001-this-is-a` | **Date**: 2025-09-15 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-this-is-a/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a comprehensive administration application for a tour company. The application will feature a secure login, a dashboard for operational overviews, and pages for managing customer bookings and tour details. The technical approach is based on a React frontend with TypeScript, Vite for building, React Router for navigation, and Material-UI for components.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: React, React Router DOM, Material-UI (MUI), Emotion
**Storage**: N/A (managed by backend)
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Testing framework not specified, e.g., Jest, Vitest]
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web Application (Frontend)
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., <200ms p95 for page loads]
**Constraints**: Authentication via `SUPERADMIN_TOKEN`.
**Scale/Scope**: Admin interface for a tour company.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [1] (frontend)
- Using framework directly? (Yes)
- Single data model? (Yes, from API)
- Avoiding patterns? (Yes)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (No, this is a frontend application)
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Process to be defined]
- Git commits show tests before implementation? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Process to be defined]
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Process to be defined]
- Real dependencies used? (Yes, real API)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? (Yes, for API contracts)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Logging strategy to be defined]
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Logging strategy to be defined]
- Error context sufficient? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error handling strategy to be defined]

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (No)
- BUILD increments on every change? (No)
- Breaking changes handled? (N/A)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application (Frontend only for this project)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research testing framework for React/Vite (Jest vs. Vitest).
   - Define performance goals for page loads.
   - Define logging strategy.
   - Define error handling strategy.
   - Clarify how `SUPERADMIN_TOKEN` is provided (header, cookie, etc.).

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Task: "Research testing frameworks for React with Vite."
   - Task: "Define best practices for web app performance metrics."
   - Task: "Design a logging strategy for a React frontend application."
   - Task: "Design an error handling strategy for a React frontend application."

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Tour, Booking, Administrator.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Endpoints for login, tours, bookings.
   - OpenAPI schema in `/contracts/`.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories.

5. **Update agent file incrementally**.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs.
- Each contract → contract test task.
- Each entity → model creation task.
- Each user story → integration test task.
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI.

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution.
**Phase 4**: Implementation.
**Phase 5**: Validation.

## Complexity Tracking
| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
