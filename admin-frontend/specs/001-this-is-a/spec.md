# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Admin Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-is-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This is a comprehensive administration application for a tour company, featuring a secure login. It provides a dashboard for operational overviews and dedicated pages for managing customer bookings, a page for tour details, and a calendar to see visually the bookings, with all administrative sections protected by authentication using a SUPERADMIN_TOKEN to ensure data security the login is easy: just calling the admin get api tours and it sould include the token and if we get the tours then the login has passed"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an administrator, I want to log in securely to the application so that I can access a dashboard, manage tour bookings, and view tour details to effectively run the tour company's operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an administrator is not logged in, **When** they provide the correct `SUPERADMIN_TOKEN`, **Then** they are granted access to the admin sections.
2. **Given** an administrator is logged in, **When** they navigate to the dashboard, **Then** they see an operational overview.
3. **Given** an administrator is logged in, **When** they navigate to the bookings page, **Then** they can manage customer bookings.
4. **Given** an administrator is logged in, **When** they navigate to the tours page, **Then** they can manage tour details.
5. **Given** a user tries to access an admin page without a valid `SUPERADMIN_TOKEN`, **Then** they are denied access.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the `SUPERADMIN_TOKEN` is invalid or expired?
- How does the system handle incorrect API calls or network errors?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a secure login mechanism for administrators.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST protect all administrative sections, ensuring they are only accessible after successful authentication.
- **FR-003**: Authenticated users MUST be able to view a dashboard with an operational overview.
- **FR-004**: Authenticated users MUST be able to manage customer bookings.
- **FR-005**: Authenticated users MUST be able to manage tour details.
- **FR-006**: Authentication MUST be performed by validating a `SUPERADMIN_TOKEN`. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How is the token provided? Via header, cookie, or query parameter?]
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide clear feedback to the user on login success or failure.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tour**: Represents a tour offered by the company. Attributes include details like name, description, price, dates.
- **Booking**: Represents a customer's booking for a tour. Attributes include customer details, tour booked, booking status.
- **Administrator**: Represents a user with full access to the system.
